# Risk Assessment Matrix

**Assessment Date**: August 9, 2025  
**Project**: @platformrocks/create CLI  
**Risk Framework**: Technical Risk Assessment Matrix

## Risk Categories

### 1. Technical Risks

#### HIGH RISK 游댮

**TR-01: No Test Coverage**

- **Impact**: High (Production failures, unsafe refactoring)
- **Probability**: High (Already exists)
- **Risk Score**: 9/10
- **Description**: Complete absence of automated tests creates risk of regressions and makes refactoring dangerous
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e)
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline with mandatory test passing
  - Target >80% code coverage
- **Timeline**: Immediate (Next 2 weeks)
- **Owner**: Development Team

**TR-02: Single Template Dependency**

- **Impact**: High (Complete service failure)
- **Probability**: Medium (GitHub outages occur)
- **Risk Score**: 7/10
- **Description**: CLI depends solely on GitHub for template access; any GitHub outage breaks functionality
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement template caching system
  - Add fallback template sources
  - Bundle basic templates with CLI
- **Timeline**: Short term (Next month)
- **Owner**: Architecture Team

#### MEDIUM RISK 游리

**TR-03: Limited Error Handling**

- **Impact**: Medium (Poor user experience)
- **Probability**: High (Various failure modes exist)
- **Risk Score**: 6/10
- **Description**: Current error handling may not cover all edge cases, leading to cryptic error messages
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive error mapping and categorization
  - User-friendly error messages with resolution suggestions
  - Implement error telemetry (opt-in)
- **Timeline**: Immediate (Next sprint)
- **Owner**: Development Team

**TR-04: Dependency Vulnerabilities**

- **Impact**: High (Security breaches)
- **Probability**: Low (Current deps are clean)
- **Risk Score**: 5/10
- **Description**: Third-party dependencies may introduce security vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement automated security scanning
  - Regular dependency audits
  - Set up vulnerability alerting
- **Timeline**: Short term (Next month)
- **Owner**: Security Team

#### LOW RISK 游릭

**TR-05: Performance Degradation**

- **Impact**: Low (Slower operation)
- **Probability**: Low (CLI is lightweight)
- **Risk Score**: 2/10
- **Description**: CLI startup or execution time may degrade with feature additions
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement performance benchmarking
  - Regular performance monitoring
  - Optimize critical paths
- **Timeline**: Long term (Next quarter)
- **Owner**: Performance Team

### 2. Operational Risks

#### MEDIUM RISK 游리

**OR-01: No Production Monitoring**

- **Impact**: Medium (Blind to production issues)
- **Probability**: Medium (Issues will occur)
- **Risk Score**: 5/10
- **Description**: No visibility into production usage, errors, or performance issues
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement opt-in telemetry
  - Error reporting system
  - Usage analytics dashboard
- **Timeline**: Short term (Next month)
- **Owner**: Operations Team

**OR-02: Manual Release Process**

- **Impact**: Medium (Release delays, human error)
- **Probability**: Medium (Manual processes fail)
- **Risk Score**: 4/10
- **Description**: Current release process may be manual, leading to inconsistent releases
- **Mitigation**:
  - Automate release process with CI/CD
  - Implement semantic versioning automation
  - Add release candidate testing
- **Timeline**: Short term (Next month)
- **Owner**: DevOps Team

#### LOW RISK 游릭

**OR-03: Documentation Drift**

- **Impact**: Low (Developer confusion)
- **Probability**: Medium (Documentation gets outdated)
- **Risk Score**: 3/10
- **Description**: Documentation may become outdated as code evolves
- **Mitigation**:
  - Automated documentation generation
  - Documentation reviews in PR process
  - Regular documentation audits
- **Timeline**: Ongoing
- **Owner**: Documentation Team

### 3. Business Risks

#### MEDIUM RISK 游리

**BR-01: Limited Adoption**

- **Impact**: High (Product failure)
- **Probability**: Low (Good architecture exists)
- **Risk Score**: 4/10
- **Description**: CLI may not gain adoption due to competition or limited features
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive template ecosystem
  - Community engagement
  - Plugin architecture for extensibility
- **Timeline**: Long term (Next quarter)
- **Owner**: Product Team

#### LOW RISK 游릭

**BR-02: Feature Creep**

- **Impact**: Medium (Complexity increase)
- **Probability**: Low (Clear architecture exists)
- **Risk Score**: 2/10
- **Description**: Adding too many features may complicate the tool and reduce reliability
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear product roadmap
  - Feature flag system
  - Regular architecture reviews
- **Timeline**: Ongoing
- **Owner**: Product Team

## Conclusion

The project has manageable risk profile with one critical area (test coverage) requiring immediate attention. Most risks have clear mitigation strategies and can be addressed through normal development cycles.

**Priority Actions**:

1. Implement comprehensive test suite (Critical)
2. Enhance error handling (High)
3. Set up monitoring and security scanning (Medium)

The strong architectural foundation provides good resilience against most identified risks, making this a low-to-medium risk project overall.
